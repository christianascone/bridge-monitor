# Token Bridge Monitor

This tool allows you to spin up a NODE.JS server to monitor for health of the Token Bridge contracts: check for the balance difference, discover incosistency in the validators list, catch unhandled transactions.

Due to reorganization of the token bridge repos into one monorepo the sources of the token bridge monitor was moved to [the TokenBridge repo](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge).

What does it mean for you? If you would like
  * to raise an issue against the monitor, follow [this link](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/issues/new).
  * to find if a new version of the monitor is ready in the monorepo, visit [the releases tab](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/releases).
  * to get access to the last changes made in this repo, check the release [`2.2.0`](https://github.com/poanetwork/bridge-monitor/releases/tag/2.2.0) or the [`master`] branch.

If you still have a question what you need to do, please visit [the TokenBridge forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/tokenbridge) and raise your question there.
